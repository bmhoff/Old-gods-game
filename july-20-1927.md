**Mysterious Lights Return to Old Mill Hollow—LC&NC Delays Dam Construction Amid Growing Unease**

Trillium, VA—The unsettling glow that haunted the ridges of Old Mill Hollow last week has returned, with more townsfolk reporting eerie green lights flickering in the night. This latest disturbance coincides with an announcement from Langley Coal and Navigation Company (LC&NC), delaying their highly anticipated dam construction—a decision that has stirred both frustration and fear among locals.

LC&NC cites “unexpected geological instability” as the reason for halting operations, though workers whisper of stranger occurrences at the construction site. Some claim to have seen shadows moving where there should be none. Others speak of deep, unnatural groans from beneath the ground, as though the land and river itself were protesting their efforts.

“The hills don’t take kindly to being rearranged,” muttered Old Tom Abernathy, a retired miner who remembers the Hollow Mine Disaster of ’21 all too well. “LC&NC can call it what they want, but folks ‘round here know better.”

This setback for LC&NC has renewed talk of longstanding local legends—that the land beneath Trillium holds forces older than memory, and that disturbing its veins might invite consequences beyond any engineer’s calculations.

Sheriff Montgomery maintains that these events are unrelated and urges townsfolk not to spread unnecessary fear. However, the growing number of workers quitting the project tells a different story. Even among those who remain, an unspoken dread lingers, a quiet warning from the hills themselves.

As Trillium waits for LC&NC’s next move, the Gazette will continue to follow this story. Residents are advised to stay indoors after dark and heed the warnings of those who understand what lies beneath the surface.
